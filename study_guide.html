        <h1 class="blink">Hundred Years War(1337 - 1453)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>During the <span class="dates">1330s</span> England gradually drifted into a state of hostility with France, for which the most obvious reason was the dispute over English rule in Gascony.</li>
            <li>King Edward the III of England, provoked by French attacks on lands he owns in France, decides upon a desparate gamble. </li>
            <li>However, under English law, possession and property can also descend to male children through the maternal bloodline.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="dates">1360s</span>, the French are winning</li>
            <li>Tradition dates it from <span class="dates">1337</span> to <span class="dates">1453</span></li>
            <li>a series of agreements signed between Great Britain and France that marked the end of hundreds of years of intermittent conflict between the two states.</li>
            <li>Conflict with the ‘ancient enemy’ has shaped the identities of both countries, and memories of the war remain long on both sides of the Channel. </li>
            <li>From <span class="dates">1415-1422</span>, the English are winning.</li>

        </ul>

        <h1 class="blink">Edward III's claim to the throne of France</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Isabella of France was the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/canterburyroll/prop/france.shtml" target="new">daughter</a> of Philip IV and Joan of Navarre.</li>
            <li> <em>She married Edward II in 1308</em> becoming <strong>Queen Consort</strong> of England.</li>
            <li><mark>After the death of Isabella's three brothers without surviving children</mark>, her cousin, Philip of Valois, became king of France as Philip VI.</li>
            <li>Edward twice attempted to invade France from the north (1339, 1340), but the only result of his campaigns was to reduce him to bankruptcy.</li>
            <li>The English claimed the right of succession through the female bloodline. <mark>From an English perspective, the crown of France should have passed to Philip III's great-grandson, Edward III of England</mark>, because this was the most direct line of descent; from a French perspective, Philip VI was the rightful king because women were excluded from succeeding to the French crown.</li>

        <h1>Battles of Crecy(1346)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="blink" id="important">the first major engagement of the Hundred Years' War</li>
            <li>Edward III landed in Normandy in July 1346 with about 10,000 men.</li>
            <li>The French pursued. Edward III decided to halt near Crecy in Normandy and to prepare for battle the next day. However, the French vanguard made contact and started to attack without the benefit of a plan.</li>
            <li>The French made as many as 15 attacks and the English checked each one in turn <mark>mainly because of the English longbowmen.</mark> </li>
            <li>At the end, the French were <span id="empa">decimated</span> and the English had a decisive victory.</li>

            <li>The battle, <mark>which saw an early use of the deadly longbow by the English</mark>, is regarded as one of the most decisive in history.</li>
            <li>Learning of the Englishmen’s arrival, King Philip rallied an army of 12,000 men, made up of approximately 8,000 mounted knights and 4,000 hired Genoese crossbowmen.</li>

        <h1>Battles of Poitiers(1356)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Following the death of Charles IV of France in 1328, Philip, Count of Valois, had been crowned as his successor, over his closest male relative and legal successor, Edward III of England. </li>
            <li id="poitiers_start">Edward arrayed his army in a defensive posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, <mark>in front of the forest of Nouallie.</mark></li>
            <li>The English army was led by Edward, the Black Prince, primarily composed of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of Gascon and Breton soldiers with the army.</li>
            <li>Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 longbowmen, 3,000 men-at-arms and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.</li>
            <li id="caseandpoint"><strong>Poitiers was a victory of English strategic defense over French military ineptitude and of the commoner armed with a longbow over the French knight. It was a resounding defeat for the forces of chivalry. It was the second great victory for the English in the Hundred Year's War, the first being Crecy.
                </strong></li>
            <li>In 1356 Edward the Black Prince, son of Edward III was leading a chevachee through the area north of Bordeaux. This was an extended raid following a scorched earth policy, aimed at depriving the French king of the ability of his population to support him. It was aimed at attacking the king through his people, rather than directly.</li>

        <h1>Battles of Agincourt(1415)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>a battle of the Hundred Years' War that resulted in a English victory</li>
            <li>Henry V invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather Edward III</li>
            <li>He initially called a Great Council in the spring of <span class="dates">1414</span> to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims.</li>

            <li>The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease.</li>
            <li> Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through Normandy to the port of Calais, the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.</li>
            <li>This was not strictly a feudal army, but an army paid through a system similar to the English.</li>
            <li>The French had raised an army during the siege which assembled around Rouen.</li>

        <h1>longbows vs crossbows</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="longbow">The longbow was a formidable weapon during the Middle Ages and thus changed the nature of warfare. </li>
            <li class="longbow">The longbow was invented by the Celts from Wales.</li>
            <li class="longbow">However due to the English military’s major use of the weapon in the Middle Ages, the weapon is usually called the English Longbow instead of the Welsh Longbow.</li>
            <li class="longbow">A bowshot was approximately 150 yards and could pierce armor at around 60 yards.</li>
            <li class="longbow">It becomes clear that the closer an archer is to his target the greater the damage and, this was accomplished by a seemingly innocuous wooden stave from a yew tree. </li>
            <li class="longbow">Longbowmen could certainly penetrate plate mail (though perhaps not at such a great distance), but longbowman were generally highly trained soldiers. </li>
            <li class="longbow">This meant that they were also expensive, and that they could not be replaced easily. (Many bowmen were recruited at a young age to master their craft.)</li>
            <li class="crossbow">During the Hundred Years War, the French utilized the crossbow as their favorite ranged weapon. </li>
            <li class="crossbow">The crossbow was really the first hand-held weapon that could be used by an untrained soldier to injure or kill a knight in plate armour. The most powerful crossbows could penetrate armour and kill at 200 yards.</li>
            <li class="crossbow">There were also crude sights, for zeroing in on a target; a bolt could pierce armor at about 200 yards. </li>
            <li class="crossbow">However, its rate of fire was less than the English longbow, at about four bolts, or quarrels, per minute, versus the 10-12 for a longbow. </li>
            <li class="crossbow">Anyone could use a crossbow though. Crossbows are easier to aim than longbows because the crossbowman doesn't have to use a hand to hold the string back while aiming.</li>
            <li class="crossbow">Crossbows are particularly inefficient when compared to longbows</li>
            <li class="crossbow">Additionally, it weighed in around 20 pounds, where a longbow came in less than 5 pounds.</li>
            <li class="crossbow">The specifications seem to indicate that the crossbow is a superior weapon in terms of velocity and accuracy, but the time required to reload, either by pulling or winching the string tight, stacked the odds against the user. </li>
            <li class="crossbow">The crossbowmen had likely tossed their pavises aside during their march, combining the additional problem of protection into the fog of battle:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Victories at Crecy and Agincourt being attributed to its armour piercing capability.</li>
            <li>It is worth remembering that padded bodkins were worn beneath body armour and as armour thickness increased so the effectiveness of the longbow diminished</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Edward the Black Prince</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>He was the eldest son of King Edward III and Philippa of Hainault, and the father of King Richard II of England. </li>
            <li>Edward was born on <span class="dates">15 June 1330</span> at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire.</li>
            <li> Married Joan on <span class="dates">10 October 1361</span> at Windsor Castle. </li>
            <li>Edward died one year before his father, becoming the first English Prince of Wales not to become King of England. </li>
            <li>On one hand, after capturing John the Good, king of France, and Philip the Bold, his youngest son, at the Battle of Poitiers, he treated them with great respect – at one point he gave John permission to return home, and reportedly prayed with John at Canterbury Cathedral.</li>
            <li>The Poitiers Campaign in the Aquitaine-Loire region, which crippled the French army for the next 13 years, fomenting the anarchy and chaos which would cause the Treaty of Brétigny to be signed in <span class="dates">1360.</span> Following this campaign, there was no French army leader, there were challenges towards Charles the Wise, and more aristocrats were killed at Crécy and Poitiers than by the Black Death.
            </li>
            <li>Edward the Black Prince seemed to have good health until <span class="dates">1366</span>. It was not until his campaign in Spain to restore Don Pedro the Cruel to the throne of Castille that he became ill.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Charles experienced delusions, believing he was made of glass or denying he had a wife and children.</li>
            <li>In general, medieval Europeans allowed the mentally ill their freedom, as long as they were not dangerous to others.</li>
            <li> With that being said there were often times when the mentally ill were labeled as witches or said to be possessed by demons.</li>

            <li>The arrival of the Black Plague in Europe and England effectively puts a damper on hostile activities. <mark>England loses approximately one-third of its population</mark>; <mark>France loses approximately one-fourth of its population.</mark></li>
