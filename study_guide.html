        <h1 class="blink">Hundred Years War(1337 - 1453)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>During the 1330s England gradually drifted into a state of hostility with France, for which the most obvious reason was the dispute over English rule in Gascony.</li>
            <li>King Edward the III of England, provoked by French attacks on lands he owns in France, decides upon a desparate gamble. </li>
            <li>However, under English law, possession and property can also descend to male children through the maternal bloodline.</li>
            <li>In the 1360s, the French are winning</li>
            <li>Tradition dates it from 1337 to 1453</li>
            <li>a series of agreements signed between Great Britain and France that marked the end of hundreds of years of intermittent conflict between the two states.</li>
            <li>Conflict with the ‘ancient enemy’ has shaped the identities of both countries, and memories of the war remain long on both sides of the Channel. </li>
            <li>From 1415-1422, the English are winning.</li>

        <h1 class="blink">Edward III's claim to the throne of France</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Isabella of France was the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/canterburyroll/prop/france.shtml" target="new">daughter</a> of Philip IV and Joan of Navarre.</li>
            <li> <em>She married Edward II in 1308</em> becoming <strong>Queen Consort</strong> of England.</li>
            <li><mark>After the death of Isabella's three brothers without surviving children</mark>, her cousin, Philip of Valois, became king of France as Philip VI.</li>
            <li>Edward twice attempted to invade France from the north (1339, 1340), but the only result of his campaigns was to reduce him to bankruptcy.</li>
            <li>The English claimed the right of succession through the female bloodline. <mark>From an English perspective, the crown of France should have passed to Philip III's great-grandson, Edward III of England</mark>, because this was the most direct line of descent; from a French perspective, Philip VI was the rightful king because women were excluded from succeeding to the French crown.</li>

            <li>Edward III landed in Normandy in July 1346 with about 10,000 men.</li>
            <li>The French pursued. Edward III decided to halt near Crecy in Normandy and to prepare for battle the next day. However, the French vanguard made contact and started to attack without the benefit of a plan.</li>
            <li>The French made as many as 15 attacks and the English checked each one in turn <mark>mainly because of the English longbowmen.</mark> </li>
            <li>At the end, the French were <span id="empa">decimated</span> and the English had a decisive victory.</li>
            
            <li>The battle, <mark>which saw an early use of the deadly longbow by the English</mark>, is regarded as one of the most decisive in history.</li>
