        <h1 class="blink">Hundred Years War(1337 - 1453)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>During the <span class="dates">1330s</span> England gradually drifted into a state of hostility with France, for which the most obvious reason was the dispute over English rule in Gascony.</li>
            <li>King Edward the III of England, provoked by French attacks on lands he owns in France, decides upon a desparate gamble. </li>
            <li>However, under English law, possession and property can also descend to male children through the maternal bloodline.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="dates">1360s</span>, the French are winning</li>
            <li>Tradition dates it from <span class="dates">1337</span> to <span class="dates">1453</span></li>
            <li>a series of agreements signed between Great Britain and France that marked the end of hundreds of years of intermittent conflict between the two states.</li>
            <li>Conflict with the ‘ancient enemy’ has shaped the identities of both countries, and memories of the war remain long on both sides of the Channel. </li>
            <li>From <span class="dates">1415-1422</span>, the English are winning.</li>

        </ul>

        <h1 class="blink">Edward III's claim to the throne of France</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Isabella of France was the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/canterburyroll/prop/france.shtml" target="new">daughter</a> of Philip IV and Joan of Navarre.</li>
            <li> <em>She married Edward II in 1308</em> becoming <strong>Queen Consort</strong> of England.</li>
            <li><mark>After the death of Isabella's three brothers without surviving children</mark>, her cousin, Philip of Valois, became king of France as Philip VI.</li>
            <li>Edward twice attempted to invade France from the north (1339, 1340), but the only result of his campaigns was to reduce him to bankruptcy.</li>
            <li>The English claimed the right of succession through the female bloodline. <mark>From an English perspective, the crown of France should have passed to Philip III's great-grandson, Edward III of England</mark>, because this was the most direct line of descent; from a French perspective, Philip VI was the rightful king because women were excluded from succeeding to the French crown.</li>

        <h1>Battles of Crecy(1346)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="blink" id="important">the first major engagement of the Hundred Years' War</li>
            <li>Edward III landed in Normandy in July 1346 with about 10,000 men.</li>
            <li>The French pursued. Edward III decided to halt near Crecy in Normandy and to prepare for battle the next day. However, the French vanguard made contact and started to attack without the benefit of a plan.</li>
            <li>The French made as many as 15 attacks and the English checked each one in turn <mark>mainly because of the English longbowmen.</mark> </li>
            <li>At the end, the French were <span id="empa">decimated</span> and the English had a decisive victory.</li>

            <li>The battle, <mark>which saw an early use of the deadly longbow by the English</mark>, is regarded as one of the most decisive in history.</li>
            <li>Learning of the Englishmen’s arrival, King Philip rallied an army of 12,000 men, made up of approximately 8,000 mounted knights and 4,000 hired Genoese crossbowmen.</li>

        <h1>Battles of Poitiers(1356)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Following the death of Charles IV of France in 1328, Philip, Count of Valois, had been crowned as his successor, over his closest male relative and legal successor, Edward III of England. </li>
            <li id="poitiers_start">Edward arrayed his army in a defensive posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, <mark>in front of the forest of Nouallie.</mark></li>
            <li>The English army was led by Edward, the Black Prince, primarily composed of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of Gascon and Breton soldiers with the army.</li>
            <li>Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 longbowmen, 3,000 men-at-arms and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.</li>
            <li id="caseandpoint"><strong>Poitiers was a victory of English strategic defense over French military ineptitude and of the commoner armed with a longbow over the French knight. It was a resounding defeat for the forces of chivalry. It was the second great victory for the English in the Hundred Year's War, the first being Crecy.

            <li>In 1356 Edward the Black Prince, son of Edward III was leading a chevachee through the area north of Bordeaux. This was an extended raid following a scorched earth policy, aimed at depriving the French king of the ability of his population to support him. It was aimed at attacking the king through his people, rather than directly.</li>
